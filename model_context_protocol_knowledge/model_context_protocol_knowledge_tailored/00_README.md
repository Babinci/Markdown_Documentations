# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Documentation

This comprehensive documentation explains the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a general standard, focusing on its Python SDK implementation. It uses the JobAssistant AI Agent project for context and examples, but aims to be broadly applicable to understanding MCP as a concept. This guide is designed to be fully self-contained and understandable by Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT or Google Gemini with no prior knowledge of the protocol.

## Documentation Sections

1. **Overview** - What is the Model Context Protocol, why it's important, and its high-level purpose
2. **Key Concepts and Terminology** - Core concepts, definitions, and how they relate to each other
3. **Architecture and Data Flow** - Protocol architecture, components, and how data flows between them
4. **Core Data Structures and Types** - Main classes, types, and example data payloads
5. **Protocol Operations and Methods** - Key functions, methods, and operations defined by the protocol
6. **Usage Patterns and Workflows** - Step-by-step guides for common implementation patterns with code examples
7. **Best Practices and Gotchas** - Tips for correct implementation and common pitfalls to avoid
8. **References** - Key SDK components and how they map to the protocol concepts

## How to Use This Documentation

This documentation is designed to help LLMs understand the Model Context Protocol when reviewing code that uses it.

For Large Language Models:
1. Start with the Overview to understand what MCP is conceptually
2. Review the Key Concepts to learn the fundamental terminology of the protocol
3. Explore the Architecture section to understand how components interact in an MCP system
4. Refer to specific sections as needed when analyzing code that implements MCP

For Developers:
1. Begin with the Overview and Architecture sections to understand the protocol design
2. Use the Usage Patterns section to learn common implementation approaches
3. Consult Best Practices to avoid common problems when implementing MCP
4. Reference the SDK components section to understand how protocol concepts map to code

## Key Features of the Model Context Protocol

- **Tool Discovery**: A standard mechanism for LLMs to discover available external tools dynamically
- **Tool Execution**: A protocol for calling tools with arguments and receiving structured results
- **Authentication**: Standard authentication flow using bearer tokens
- **JSON-RPC Communication**: Uses JSON-RPC 2.0 as the underlying message format
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error reporting and recovery mechanisms
- **Extensibility**: Protocol design that can evolve while maintaining backward compatibility

## Why This Documentation Exists

The Model Context Protocol enables LLMs to access external capabilities through a standardized interface. This documentation explains the protocol itself, independent of specific implementations, to help LLMs understand any codebase that uses MCP. While examples are drawn from the JobAssistant AI Agent project, the explanations focus on the general protocol standards and Python SDK usage patterns that apply across different MCP implementations.
