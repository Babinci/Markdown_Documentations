# Edge Functions

Supabase Edge Functions are server-side TypeScript functions that are distributed globally at the edgeâ€”close to your users. They enable you to run server-side code without having to deploy or manage your own servers.

## Overview

Edge Functions provide a versatile way to extend your Supabase projects with custom server-side logic. They're particularly useful for:

- Handling webhooks from third-party services
- Integrating with external APIs
- Processing data before it reaches your database
- Implementing custom authentication flows
- Running operations that shouldn't happen on the client

Edge Functions are built on [Deno](https://deno.com/), which offers several benefits:

- **Open Source**: Deno is fully open source and community-driven
- **Portable**: Functions run locally during development and on any Deno-compatible platform in production
- **TypeScript Native**: First-class TypeScript support without configuration
- **Secure by Default**: No file, network, or environment access unless explicitly enabled
- **WebAssembly Support**: Run code compiled to WASM for high-performance computing
- **Globally Distributed**: Deploy once, run in multiple regions for low-latency responses

## Getting Started

To begin working with Edge Functions, follow the [quickstart guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/functions/quickstart) which walks you through creating, testing, and deploying your first function.

## Example Use Cases

### API Integrations

Edge Functions are perfect for interacting with third-party APIs like payment processors, messaging services, or AI platforms:

- Process Stripe payments and handle webhooks
- Integrate with messaging platforms like Discord or Telegram
- Connect to AI services like OpenAI or Hugging Face
- Send emails through providers like Resend or SendGrid

### Data Processing

Transform, validate, or process data before it reaches your database:

- Clean and validate form submissions
- Process uploaded files before storing them
- Generate thumbnails or transform images
- Convert data formats (CSV to JSON, etc.)

### Custom Authentication

Implement specialized authentication flows:

- Create custom sign-up processes
- Handle social login providers
- Implement multi-factor authentication logic
- Generate custom JWT tokens

### Backend-for-Frontend

Create tailored APIs for your frontend applications:

- Aggregate data from multiple sources
- Implement rate limiting and request validation
- Create RESTful or GraphQL interfaces
