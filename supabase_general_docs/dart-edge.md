# Dart Edge

> **Note:** Be aware that the Dart Edge project is currently not actively maintained due to numerous breaking changes in Dart's development of WASM support.

[Dart Edge](https://docs.dartedge.dev/) is an experimental project that enables you to write Supabase Edge Functions using Dart. It's built and maintained by [Invertase](https://invertase.io/).

For detailed information on how to set up and use Dart Edge with Supabase, refer to the [official Dart Edge documentation for Supabase](https://invertase.docs.page/dart_edge/platform/supabase).
