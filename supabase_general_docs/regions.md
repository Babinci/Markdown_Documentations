## Choosing a Region

When selecting a region for your Supabase project, consider the following factors:

### 1. Proximity to Users

Choose a region that is geographically close to the majority of your users to minimize latency.

### 2. Compliance Requirements

Some applications have legal or regulatory requirements to store data in specific regions or countries.

### 3. Available Features

Certain features may be available only in specific regions. Check the documentation for any feature-specific region limitations.

### 4. Pricing

While Supabase pricing is consistent across regions, underlying infrastructure costs from AWS may vary slightly by region.

## Changing Regions

Currently, you cannot change the region of an existing project. If you need to move your project to a different region, you'll need to:

1. Create a new project in the desired region
2. Migrate your data to the new project
3. Update your application to connect to the new project

For more information about migrating between projects, see the [Migrating within Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/migrating-and-upgrading-projects) guide.

## Region Availability and SLAs

Supabase leverages AWS infrastructure which offers industry-leading availability and reliability. However, availability may vary by region. For mission-critical applications, consider implementing multi-region strategies for increased resilience.
