# Manage Realtime Messages Usage

This guide explains how Supabase Realtime Messages are billed and how to monitor your usage.

## What You Are Charged For

You are charged for the number of messages going through Supabase Realtime throughout the billing cycle. This includes database changes, Broadcast, and Presence.

### Database Changes

Each database change counts as one message per client that listens to the event. For example, if a database change occurs and 5 clients listen to that database event, it counts as 5 messages.

### Broadcast

Each broadcast message counts as one message sent plus one message per subscribed client that receives it. For example, if you broadcast a message and 4 clients listen to it, it counts as 5 messagesâ€”1 sent and 4 received.

## How Charges Are Calculated

Realtime Messages are billed using Package pricing, with each package representing 1 million messages. If your usage falls between two packages, you are billed for the next whole package.

### Example

For simplicity, let's assume a package size of 1,000,000 and a charge of $2.50 per package without quota.

| Messages | Packages Billed | Costs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 999,999 | 1 | $2.50 |
| 1,000,000 | 1 | $2.50 |
| 1,000,001 | 2 | $5.00 |
| 1,500,000 | 2 | $5.00 |

### Usage on Your Invoice

Usage is shown as "Realtime Messages" on your invoice.

## Pricing

$2.50 per 1 million messages. You are only charged for usage exceeding your subscription plan's quota.

| Plan | Quota | Over-Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Free | 2 million | - |
| Pro | 5 million | $2.50 per 1 million messages |
| Team | 5 million | $2.50 per 1 million messages |
| Enterprise | Custom | Custom |

## Managing Usage

To control your Realtime Messages usage, consider these strategies:

1. **Optimize client connections**: Ensure clients only subscribe to the channels they need and unsubscribe when they're done.

2. **Filter database changes**: Use more specific filters when subscribing to database changes to reduce the number of messages.

3. **Implement throttling**: Consider adding throttling mechanisms for high-frequency events.

4. **Use batch updates**: Instead of multiple individual database changes, batch them together when possible.

5. **Monitor usage regularly**: Check your usage dashboard frequently to identify unexpected spikes.
