# Converted GitHub Account to Organization - Lost Supabase Account Access

This guide explains what to do if you've lost access to your Supabase account after converting your GitHub account to an organization.

## Problem

[Converting](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-your-personal-account/converting-a-user-into-an-organization) your GitHub account to a [GitHub organization](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/types-of-github-accounts#organization-accounts) will cause you to lose access to all other accounts using GitHub sign-ins, including your Supabase account.

## Solution

Supabase can help you transfer ownership of an existing organization on your account by inviting a new owner to your organization. Here's what you need to do:

1. Create a new user account with a different email address from the previous one
2. Email [support@supabase.com](mailto:support@supabase.com) with the new email address
3. Supabase will verify your ownership of the email address and help transfer ownership to the new account

This allows you to regain access to your Supabase projects without losing any data or configuration.
