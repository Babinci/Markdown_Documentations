# Migrating within Supabase

Learn how to migrate from one Supabase project to another.

If you are on a Paid Plan and have physical backups enabled, you should use the [Restore to another project feature](backups.md#restore-to-a-new-project) instead of the methods described below.

## Database migration guides

If you need to migrate from one Supabase project to another, choose the appropriate guide below:

### Backup file from the dashboard (*.backup)

Follow the [Restore dashboard backup guide](dashboard-restore.md) to migrate using dashboard backup files.

### SQL backup files (*.sql)

Follow the [Backup and Restore using the CLI guide](backup-restore.md) to migrate using SQL backup files.

## Transfer project to a different organization

Project migration is primarily for changing regions or upgrading to new major versions of the platform in some scenarios. If you need to move your project to a different organization without touching the infrastructure, see [project transfers](project-transfer.md).
