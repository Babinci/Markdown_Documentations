# Resolving "Forbidden Resource" Errors in the Supabase CLI

When using the Supabase CLI, you might encounter a "Forbidden resource" error. This error is a security measure that prevents unauthorized access to protected operations and resources within your Supabase project.

## Common Error Messages

The error message might appear in different forms, such as:

```
Error: Forbidden resource: <resource>
```

or

```
Error: Authorization failed. You don't have access to this resource.
```

## Troubleshooting Steps

Follow these steps to resolve the forbidden resource error:

### 1. Verify Your Project Reference ID

Ensure you're using the correct Project Reference ID in your commands:

```bash
supabase db pull --project-ref <project-ref>
```

Your Project Reference ID can be found in the [Project Settings > General](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/general) section of your Supabase Dashboard. It typically looks like `xvljpkujuwroxcuvossw`.

### 2. Check Your Authorization

Verify that your CLI is properly authenticated with Supabase:

```bash
supabase status
```

If you're not authenticated or your token has expired, generate a new Access Token:

1. Go to [Dashboard > Account > Access Tokens](https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens)
2. Create a new token
3. Login with the new token:
   ```bash
   supabase login --token <your-access-token>
   ```

### 3. Re-link Your Project

Sometimes, you need to re-establish the link between your local project and your Supabase project:

```bash
supabase link --project-ref <project-ref>
```

This refreshes the connection and updates local configuration.

### 4. Verify Your Permissions

Ensure you have the appropriate role (Owner or Administrator) for the project:

1. Check your role in the [Dashboard > Project > Settings > Members](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/members)
2. If you're not an Owner or Administrator, ask a project Owner to upgrade your permissions

### 5. Update the CLI

Make sure you're using the latest version of the Supabase CLI:

```bash
# For Homebrew
brew upgrade supabase

# For other platforms, download the latest version from:
# https://github.com/supabase/cli/releases
```

## Advanced Troubleshooting

If the issue persists after trying the steps above, run your command with debug flags and create a support ticket:

```bash
supabase db pull --project-ref <project-ref> --debug --create-ticket
```

This will generate a ticket ID and detailed logs that you can share with Supabase Support to help diagnose the issue.

## Common Causes

1. **Expired or Revoked Token**: Access tokens might expire or be revoked
2. **Permission Changes**: Your role in the project might have changed
3. **Project Ownership Transfer**: If the project has been transferred to a different organization
4. **CLI Version Mismatch**: Using an outdated CLI version that lacks required features
5. **Network Issues**: Proxy, firewall, or other network restrictions affecting CLI communication

If you've tried all troubleshooting steps and still encounter the error, contact [Supabase Support](https://supabase.com/support) with your ticket ID and debug logs.
