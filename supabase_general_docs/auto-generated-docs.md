# Auto-generated Documentation

Supabase generates documentation in the [Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard) which updates as you make database changes.

## How to Access the Documentation

1. Go to the [API](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/api) page in the Dashboard.
2. Select any table under **Tables and Views** in the sidebar.
3. Switch between the JavaScript and the cURL docs using the tabs.

This documentation is automatically updated whenever you make changes to your database schema, ensuring that your API documentation is always in sync with your current database structure.
