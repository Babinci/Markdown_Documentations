# Handling Complex Operations with Stored Functions

When client libraries can't directly perform complex database operations, you can use stored functions as a solution.

## Problem

Some database operations are too complex to implement directly using the Supabase client libraries.

## Solution

In cases where operations are overly complex or not feasible to implement directly using the client libraries, leverage stored functions within your database.

Follow these steps to create and run a stored function:

### Step 1: Create the Stored Function

1. Go to the [SQL query editor](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/sql/new) on your database dashboard.
2. Run the following SQL script to create a stored function tailored to your specific complex query:

```sql
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS get_my_complex_query;

CREATE FUNCTION get_my_complex_query(parameter INT)
RETURNS TABLE (column1 INTEGER, column2 VARCHAR, column3 DATE) AS
$$
BEGIN
    RETURN QUERY
    SELECT t1.column1, t1.column2, t2.column3
    FROM "TableName1" AS t1
    INNER JOIN "TableName2" AS t2 ON t1.column = t2.column
    INNER JOIN "TableName3" AS t3 ON t2.another_column = t3.another_column
    LEFT JOIN "TableName4" AS t4 ON t3.some_column = t4.some_column
    WHERE t2.column = parameter
    AND t3.column_name = 'some_value';
END;
$$
LANGUAGE plpgsql VOLATILE;
```

### Step 2: Call the Stored Function

Use the `supabase.rpc` method to call the stored function from your application code:

```javascript
supabase.rpc("get_my_complex_query", { parameter: 1 })
  .then(response => {
    // Handle the response
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // Handle errors
  });
```
