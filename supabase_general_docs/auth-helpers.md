# Auth Helpers

> **Deprecation Notice**: The Auth helpers package is deprecated. Use the new `@supabase/ssr` package for Server Side Authentication. `@supabase/ssr` takes the core concepts of the Auth Helpers package and makes them available to any server framework. Check out the [migration doc](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/server-side/migrating-to-ssr-from-auth-helpers) to learn more.

Working with server-side frameworks is slightly different to client-side frameworks. In this section we cover the various ways of handling server-side authentication and demonstrate how to use the Supabase helper-libraries to make the process more seamless.

## Framework-specific Helpers

- [**Next.js**](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-helpers/nextjs) - Helpers for authenticating users in Next.js applications.
