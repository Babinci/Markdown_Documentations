# Response - Change Status Code [¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/response-change-status-code/\#response-change-status-code "Permanent link")

You probably read before that you can set a default [Response Status Code](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-status-code/).

But in some cases you need to return a different status code than the default.

## Use case [¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/response-change-status-code/\#use-case "Permanent link")

For example, imagine that you want to return an HTTP status code of "OK" `200` by default.

But if the data didn't exist, you want to create it, and return an HTTP status code of "CREATED" `201`.

But you still want to be able to filter and convert the data you return with a `response_model`.

For those cases, you can use a `Response` parameter.

## Use a `Response` parameter [¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/response-change-status-code/\#use-a-response-parameter "Permanent link")

You can declare a parameter of type `Response` in your _path operation function_ (as you can do for cookies and headers).

And then you can set the `status_code` in that _temporal_ response object.

[Python 3.8+](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/response-change-status-code/#__tabbed_1_1)

```md-code__content
from fastapi import FastAPI, Response, status

app = FastAPI()

tasks = {"foo": "Listen to the Bar Fighters"}

@app.put("/get-or-create-task/{task_id}", status_code=200)
def get_or_create_task(task_id: str, response: Response):
    if task_id not in tasks:
        tasks[task_id] = "This didn't exist before"
        response.status_code = status.HTTP_201_CREATED
    return tasks[task_id]

```

And then you can return any object you need, as you normally would (a `dict`, a database model, etc).

And if you declared a `response_model`, it will still be used to filter and convert the object you returned.

**FastAPI** will use that _temporal_ response to extract the status code (also cookies and headers), and will put them in the final response that contains the value you returned, filtered by any `response_model`.

You can also declare the `Response` parameter in dependencies, and set the status code in them. But keep in mind that the last one to be set will win.
