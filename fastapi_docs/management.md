# Repository Management [¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/management/\#repository-management "Permanent link")

Here's a short description of how the FastAPI repository is managed and maintained.

## Owner [¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/management/\#owner "Permanent link")

I, [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo), am the creator and owner of the FastAPI repository. 🤓

I normally give the final review to each PR before merging them. I make the final decisions on the project, I'm the [BDFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life). 😅

## Team [¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/management/\#team "Permanent link")

There's a team of people that help manage and maintain the project. 😎

They have different levels of permissions and [specific instructions](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/management-tasks/).

Some of the tasks they can perform include:

- Adding labels to PRs.
- Editing PR titles.
- Adding commits on top of PRs to tweak them.
- Mark answers in GitHub Discussions questions, etc.
- Merge some specific types of PRs.

You can see the current team members in [FastAPI People - Team](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/fastapi-people/#team).

Joining the team is by invitation only, and I could update or remove permissions, instructions, or membership.

## FastAPI Experts [¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/management/\#fastapi-experts "Permanent link")

The people that help others the most in GitHub Discussions can become [**FastAPI Experts**](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/fastapi-people/#fastapi-experts).

This is normally the best way to contribute to the project.

## External Contributions [¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/management/\#external-contributions "Permanent link")

External contributions are very welcome and appreciated, including answering questions, submitting PRs, etc. 🙇‍♂️
