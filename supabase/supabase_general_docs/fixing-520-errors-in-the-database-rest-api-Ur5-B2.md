# Fixing 520 Errors in the Database REST API

## Problem

When working with the Supabase Database API, you may occasionally encounter Cloudflare 520 errors. These typically occur when your request contains more than 16KB of data in the headers or URL.

The error message may look like this:
```
Error 520: Web server is returning an unknown error
```

This error is most commonly triggered when using lengthy filter conditions, especially with large `in` clauses or complex queries that result in very long URLs.

## Cause

Supabase's REST API translates your client-side query operations into URL parameters. For example, a simple query like:

```javascript
let { data: countries, error } = await supabase.from('countries').select('name')
```

becomes a URL request like:

```
https://<project ref>.supabase.co/rest/v1/countries?select=name
```

However, when your query contains a substantial amount of data (such as a long list of IDs in an `in` clause), the URL can exceed Cloudflare's 16KB limit, resulting in a 520 error.

For example, this query might cause the error:

```javascript
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('countries')
  .select()
  .not('id', 'in', '(5,6,7,8,9,...10,000)')
```

## Solution: Using Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs)

To solve this issue, you need to move the data from the URL to the request body. This can be accomplished using Supabase's Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs), which are database functions you can call from the API.

### Step 1: Create a Database Function

First, create a PostgreSQL function in your Supabase project:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION filter_by_ids(ids UUID[])
RETURNS SETOF your_table
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
SET search_path = public
AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY
  SELECT * FROM your_table
  WHERE id = ANY(ids);
END;
$$;
```

Replace `your_table` with your actual table name and adjust the query as needed for your specific filtering requirements.

### Step 2: Call the Function via RPC

Now, instead of using a direct query with a large `in` clause, call the function using the `rpc` method:

```javascript
const { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('filter_by_ids', { 
  ids: ['e2f34fb9-bbf9-4649-9b2f-09ec56e67a42', '...', '...'] // Add your list of IDs here
})
```

This approach sends the array of IDs in the request body rather than the URL, avoiding the 16KB limit.

## Example with Logging

Here's a more detailed example that includes logging to verify the function is working correctly:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION example(id UUID[])
RETURNS UUID[]
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Log the size of the array being passed to the function
  RAISE LOG 'The function example was called with an array size of: %', 
            (SELECT array_length(id, 1));
  
  -- Return the array (you would normally process it and return results)
  RETURN id;
END;
$$;
```

Calling this function from your client:

```javascript
const { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('example', { 
  id: ['e2f34fb9-bbf9-4649-9b2f-09ec56e67a42', /* ...many more UUIDs... */] 
})
```

## Other Considerations

1. **Security**: When creating custom functions, always consider security implications. Use `SECURITY DEFINER` carefully and ensure proper Row Level Security (RLS) policies are in place.

2. **Performance**: For extremely large datasets, consider pagination or more efficient filtering techniques.

3. **Monitoring**: If you frequently encounter 520 errors, consider setting up monitoring and logging to identify patterns in your API usage.

4. **Request Size Limits**: While this approach helps with URL size limitations, there are still limits on the total size of your request. Very large payloads may require splitting into multiple requests.

5. **Caching**: For read-heavy operations with large datasets, consider implementing caching strategies to reduce the frequency of large requests.
