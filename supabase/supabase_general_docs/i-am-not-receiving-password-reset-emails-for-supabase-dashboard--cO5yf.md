# Not Receiving Password Reset Emails for Supabase Dashboard

Last edited: 2/21/2025

If you're not receiving password reset emails for your Supabase Dashboard account, this is most likely due to one of the following reasons:

## GitHub Authentication

The most common reason for not receiving password reset emails is that you originally signed up for Supabase using GitHub authentication rather than email/password. If this is the case:

1. Try logging in using the "Continue with GitHub" option instead of email/password
2. Make sure you're using the same GitHub account that you originally used to sign up

## Troubleshooting Steps

If you're still unable to access your account:

1. Check your spam/junk folder for the reset email
2. Verify you're using the correct email address that's associated with your Supabase account
3. Add noreply@supabase.co to your email contacts/safe senders list
4. Try requesting another password reset

## Contact Support

If you've tried the steps above and still cannot access your account, contact Supabase support:

1. Email [support@supabase.com](mailto:support@supabase.com) from the email address associated with your account
2. Include a screenshot of any error messages you're receiving
3. Provide details about the login methods you've attempted
4. Include your account information so the support team can locate your account

The Supabase support team will help you regain access to your account.
