You can reset your database password from the [database settings page](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/database) on the project dashboard.

1. Navigate to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to Project Settings > Database
3. Find the "Database Password" section
4. Click "Reset Database Password"
5. Confirm the action

After resetting, make sure to update any connection strings in your applications that use this password.
