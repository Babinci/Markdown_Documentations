# Enterprise Single Sign-On

## Overview

Supabase Auth provides support for building enterprise applications that require Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication using SAML 2.0 protocol.

## What is Enterprise SSO?

Enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) allows organizations to centralize authentication through their existing identity provider (IdP). SSO enables users to access multiple applications with a single set of credentials, enhancing security while simplifying user experience.

## SAML 2.0 Support

Supabase Auth offers robust SAML 2.0 integration capabilities. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is an open standard that enables secure exchange of authentication and authorization data between an identity provider and a service provider.

For detailed implementation instructions, refer to our comprehensive [SAML 2.0 Integration Guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/sso/auth-sso-saml).
